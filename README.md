# CodeLock
This is a personal project of mine involving APIs, android development, leetcode, and an attempt to fight against procrastination. 
## Why
The idea behind this project is to create an app that will stop you from going on your phone and getting distracted when you're trying to lock in and become a better software developer. Leetcode. I found an API that can check if a leetcode user has submitted an accepted 
solution for a problem. When you or I decide its time to solve some problems, we will go on the app and with our permission, will restrict our access to our phone until we submit a solution that is accepetd. Once we have, our phone will be freed and we can reflect on what 
we've learned from solving the problem. This is the main use of the app. I also have ideas to implement a streak system to further promote consistant leetcode solving and personal development in one's technical ability. Another idea is to have a set time for the app to 
activate daily to even furhter promote consistency.
## Inspiration
I procrastinate. I also get distracted. I want to change. This is my attempt at that. Also, I was studying with friends one time and one of them installed a similar app that just locks your phone so that he could stop going on tiktok every 2 minutes. Many months later I
thought about that app and about leetcode and thus here I am.
